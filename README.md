This Django Project is a Webscraper which enabels the specific search in the database of the Website PiHKAL(https://isomerdesign.com/PiHKAL/).
There are about 15000 Substances, and if you want to be sure that even new ones are included in the db, just reload the database. 
It's possible to search for the SMILES, the molecular formula as well as the molecular_weight with a changable tolerance. 
(The function to search for changes and newSubstances isn't ready yet)
Usage:
-Download everything and store it under:  C:\U s e r s\U s e r\P y c h a r m P r o j e c t s\
(or you can change the path in the start_scraper.bat-file however you like)

-to open, just click on start_scraper.bat
